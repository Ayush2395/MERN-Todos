# MERN TODO List

### Steps to run this project
- Clone this repo in a particular folder.
- Open each folder in vscode terminal `cd frontend` & `cd backend`.
- Install all dependencies by type `npm i` in each terminal.
- After intalling all dependencies, run the script of backend in `npm run dev`, It will start your backend developer server.
- Also start the frontend server, from frontend folder.
- Create `.env` file inside backend and paste your `MONGO_URI="string"` from MongoDB database.
- Also include the PORT and SECRET inside `.env` file.
- Enjoy the project, and ignore the frontend part, because I haven't working on the frontend part, my main goal is to explore the MERN stack and that's it, nex time the UI of the project will be in good shape.
